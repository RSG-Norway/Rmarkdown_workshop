# Rmarkdown_workshop

This is the repository for the *RSG Norway workshop* introducing *RMarkdown*.

Here you will find a document (`Example.Rmd`) with many examples that could be used as a template for your projects.

Overall these are the features included in the document:

- Combining text and `R` code: ordered/unordered lists, bold/italics, equations, footnotes.
- Insert citations:  required format and change citation styles. 
- Tables (static and interactive).
- Figures: convert a figure generated by `ggplot` to an interactive plot using `plotly`.
- Load figures with `.png` or `.jpeg` format.
- Load figures stored as `.Rdata`.
- Multi-panel figures
- Embeded figures in tabs

The output of `Example.Rmd` is an `html` document, altough RMarkdown allows to export `PDF` documents, in this example we will use the `html` output because it allows to have interactive features.


## :computer: Install required software

git clone https://github.com/RSG-Norway/Rmarkdown_workshop.git
cd Rmarkdown_workshop
```

### R libraries

The following R packages are required to run the `Example.rmd` document, you can install these packages within `R` using the following commands

```R
required.libraries <- c("cowplot",        ## Many (gg)plots in the same frame
                        "dplyr",          ## Data manipulation
                        "DT",             ## Interactive tables
                        "ggplot2",        ## Plotting
                        "ggridges",
                        "grid",           ## Many figures and plots in the same frame
                        "gridExtra",      ## ## Many figures and plots in the same frame
                        "htmlwidgets",    ## Required to visualize/export interactive ggplots
                        "jpeg",           ## Upload figures in jpeg format
                        "palmerpenguins", ## Example dataset
                        "plotly",         ## Converts static ggplot in interactive figures
                        "png",            ## Upload figures in png format
                        "rmarkdown"       ## Utilities
                      )


## Load the required libraries (or install them if they are missing)
for (lib in required.libraries) {
  if (!require(lib, character.only = TRUE)) {
    install.packages(lib)
    suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(lib, character.only = TRUE))
  }
}
```
